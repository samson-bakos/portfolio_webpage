				<h2>SnoopChat</h2>
				<h4> Snoop Dogg AI Text-to-Speech Persona | April 2024</h4>
				<p>Key Skills: OpenAI, Google Cloud Platform, Audio Processing, Python, Streamlit</p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/samson-bakos/snoopchat">GitHub Link</a></p>
				<p><a href="https://snoopchat.streamlit.app">App Link</a></p>

				<p>SnoopChat is a text-to-speech application that allows users to interact with a virtual representation
					of Snoop Dogg. I undertook this project to develop my understanding of modern AI tools and
					technologies, including fine tuning of GPT models and AI Voice Synthesis. I selected Snoop Dogg as a
					subject due to the challenge of his unique voice and style of speaking.</p>

				<h3>Project Overview</h3>
				<p><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong> Initial transcripts were sourced from SnoopDoggTV's YouTube
					segments, but it was challenging to get a clean transcript from YouTube’s automated captioning.
					To improve quality, I used a more detailed extended interview with Larry King, which provided
					clearer insights into Snoop's speech patterns.</p>
				<p><strong>AI Modeling:</strong> The data was processed and fine-tuned using GPT-3.5, focusing on
					accurately reflecting Snoop's unique vocabulary and style. While it is possible to achieve Snoop
					Dogg-like speech by prompting GPT-3.5 directly, I compared this output against actual transcripts of
					Snoop’s speech and found a non-fine-tuned model gave an overly embellished, stereotypical version of
					Snoop’s speech.</p>
				<p><strong>Voice Synthesis:</strong> I extracted audio clips from Snoop’s YouTube channel and used
					Google Cloud Platform’s voice transcription to extract timestamps for different speakers. I then
					extracted and concatenated the clips corresponding to Snoop’s speech to create a cohesive voice
					sample. I then trained a voice synthesis model with gemelo.ai, ensuring the virtual voice closely
					matched the real Snoop Dogg.</p>
				<p><strong>Interface Development:</strong> I developed a simple, user-friendly web interface with
					Streamlit,
					allowing easy interaction with the AI.</p>

				<h3>Challenges and Learning</h3>
				<p>The project highlighted the importance of quality data in AI training and the challenges of voice
					synthesis. The limited data used led to potential overfitting to the given prompts (~250 total),
					suggesting future improvements with access to more a diverse dataset of Snoop's speech.</p>
				<p>SnoopChat is a work in progress. Try it live and share your feedback to help develop it further!

				<h2> Predicting Floods in Canadian Rivers</h2>
				<h4> BGC Engineering | MDS Capstone Project | April - July 2023</h4>
				<p> <a href="https://github.com/samson-bakos/capstone_report"> GitHub Link</a></p>

				<p> This project focused on the prediction of flood magnitudes in Canadian rivers. While the flows of
					many rivers are actively monitored, many more are not. Estimates of maximum flow in these
					unmonitored rivers are necessary to safely design infrastructure in the surrounding areas. </p>
				<p> My team focused on making improvements to the existing standard methodology, as outlined by the US
					Geological Survey. This methodology has multiple components, including grouping of similar rivers,
					fitting of distributions, and mean/quantile flow predictions. My team explored possible improvements
					to all aspects of the existing approach, using modernized machine learning and applied statistics to
					create a system that reduced error by 84% at the key design-flood threshold, as well as automating a
					time consuming manual step
					requiring
					expert domain knowledge. </p>
				<p> Our system is currently in use by BGC's Engineers and Hydrologists to guide engineering decisions to
					keep Canadian communities safe. Our project was also selected as a 'Top 3 Best Project'
					by UBC MDS peers and faculty. You can read the full report at the link above.

				<h2> Wordle Cheater</h2>
				<h4> Statistical Solver for the Daily Wordle | July 2023</h4>
				<p> Key Skills: Python, Applied Statistics, Streamlit, NumPy, Git/Github, CSS</p>
				<p> <a href="https://wordle-cheater.streamlit.app"> App Link</a></p>
				<p> <a href="https://github.com/samson-bakos/Wordle-Assist"> GitHub Link</a></p>
				<p> My take on a solver for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html"> NY Times
						Wordle Puzzle.</a></p>
				<p> I created this project partially as an excuse to learn Streamlit as an intuitive platform for ML
					webapp development, but mostly because my fiance is
					much better at Wordle than I am. </p>
				<p>It works by selecting the word with the highest joint probability
					of its letters being in the correct position from a list of remaining possible solutions,
					filtering the list and re-ranking solution probabilities based on user input at each step.
					Experimentation has found this implementation requires only 3.5
					guesses per solve, compared to the global user average of 4.016.
				</p>
				<p> I also spent time modifying the UI using custom CSS, and it is designed to mimic the layout of the
					traditional Wordle board, especially on a dark mode browser. Give it a try at the link above!</p>

				<h2> MacroView / MacroMatch</h2>
				<h4> Macronutrient Tracker Dashboards | March 2023</h4>
				<p> Key Skills: R, R Shiny, ggplot2, Git/Github, CI/CD, HTML, Python, Plotly Dash, Altair</p>
				<p> <a href=https://macroview.shinyapps.io/MacroView> App Link - Full Version (R)</a></p>
				<p> <a href=https://macromatch.onrender.com> App Link - Single Recipe (Python)</a></p>
				<p> <a href=https://github.com/samson-bakos/MacroView> GitHub Link - Full Version (R)</a></p>
				<p> <a href=https://github.com/samson-bakos/MacroMatch> GitHub Link - Single Recipe (Python)</a></p>
				<p> I developed this project for UBC DSCI 532 - Visualization II. For this project I was interested in
					innovating and pushing the boundaries of dashboard functionality. Rather than simply visualizing a
					dataset, I wanted my dashboard to serve an active use case. Around this time, the macronutrient
					tracker app MyFitnessPal moved many of its popular features to a premium subscription, and I was
					interested in using my dashboards to create an open-source replacement.
				</p>
				<p> I developed the main R Shiny version in a small group, which can be used to set macronutrient goals
					and
					track a full day of intake, similar to the functionality of MyFitnessPal. I developed the smaller
					scale Plotly Dash app independently, and it can be used to calculate the macros of a chosen
					recipe. The nutritional values are drawn from the Canadian Food Guide public dataset. </p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/toa.webp" alt="" /></span>
				<h2> CompAssist</h2>
				<h4> Video Game Probability Calculator | Feb 2023</h4>
				<p> Key Skills: Package/ Library Development, Python, R, SciPy, Applied Statistics, CI/CD </p>
				<p> <a href=https://github.com/samson-bakos/compassist> GitHub Link - Python Package</a></p>
				<p> <a href=https://github.com/samson-bakos/compassistr> GitHub Link - R Library</a></p>
				<p> I built this project for DSCI 524 - Collaborative Software Development. It was inspired by a
					real-life statistical problem I ran into during winter break in the UBC MDS. Many video games have
					multiple rewards from a single encounter, and many players set the goal to obtain all of them. It is
					trivial to calculate the number completions needed when all rewards have the same drop rate,
					or there are only a few, but when there are multiple rewards with different rates, the problem
					becomes much more complicated.
				</p>
				<p> Specifically, I wanted to know the number of completions required to finish the Tombs of Amascut
					raid in
					Old
					School Runescape. There are seven rewards (with 5040 possible drop permutations), each having a
					different
					chance of being obtained. I developed some specific Python code, but realized that
					similar problems are present for other RuneScape bosses, as well as in many other videogames.
					DSCI 524
					offered me a convenient opportunity to create a general solution as a Python Package/ R Library for
					public
					use.
				</p>
				<p>
					Along with my teammates, we worked from this original idea to expand out the functionality of the
					package/library.
					In addition to the original calculation function, we
					added
					a modified binomial probability calculator to visualize how lucky/unlucky a user is, a method to
					select the optimal play method from multiple candidates, and a calculator specific for hunting
					'Shiny' Pokemon. You can explore the apps in the links above, as well as using the publicly
					available versions on PyPi and CRAN.

				<h2> Credit Default Predictor</h2>
				<h4> Supervized Learning Classification System | Dec 2022</h4>
				<p> Key Skills: Python, SciKit-Learn, Machine Learning, Pandas, NumPy, Git/Github</p>
				<p> <a
						href=https://github.com/samson-bakos/credit-default-predictor/blob/main/default-predictor-notebook.ipynb>
						GitHub Link</a></p>
				<p> One of my earliest data science projects, I created this project during winter break after the first
					three blocks of the UBC MDS. After very quickly covering the fundamentals of supervized machine
					learning, I wanted to consolidate my understanding with an exploratory project.</p>
				<p> I tried to cover as much ground as possible with this project, investigating multiple classification
					algorithms in parallel to create an optimized model to predict if a credit card user would default
					on next month's payment based on their past behavior, including both SciKit-Learn native
					algorithms, and other Boosted Tree based models (i.e. LightGBM). I also explored extra steps such as
					feature engineering/ feature selection/ feature importance interpretation, and performed fine tuning
					of hyperparameters on strong candidate algorithms. I assessed candidates using multiple
					classification criteria, including
					ROC/PR curves and confusion matrices, and thoroughly explained my thinking on the precision/recall
					tradeoff for this problem. Finally, I selected and evaluated a threshold modified random forest
					model on the
					test set, where it achieved 83% recall at a reasonable precision threshold </p>
				<p> I now use this project as a self-constructed workflow documentation for classification problems,
					referring back it for inspiration and syntax when approaching similar problems in my data science
					practice. This workflow could also be easily adapted to a real life credit assessment context to
					improve risk management, increase assessment efficiency, and prevent loss of revenue. You can see
					the full document at the GitHub link above.

				<h2> Cervical Cancer Prediction </h2>
				<h4> Reproducible Data Analysis Pipeline | Nov 2022</h4>
				<p> <a href=https://github.com/samson-bakos/cervical-cancer-risk>
						GitHub Link</a></p>
				<p> Key Skills: Docker, Make, Git/Github, R Markdown, SciKit-Learn, Machine Learning </p>
				<p> My first ever data science project! I developed this project in a small group for DSCI 522 - Data
					Science Workflows, early in my studies in the UBC MDS. This was my first experience with proper
					collaborative development using Git, as well as tackling a machine learning problem
					as a group. While there is some limited value to the ML approach explored, the primary objective of
					this project was to gain exposure to tools for reproducible data analysis, such as shell scripting,
					GNU Make, and Docker, as well as advanced data science reporting using R Markdown.

				<h2> Data Scientist Intern</h2>
				<h4> BGC Engineering | April - July 2023</h4>
				<p> Following the completion of my UBC MDS coursework, I worked with BGC
					Engineering to update their
					system for
					predicting floods in Canadian rivers. Our task was to predict the "One in
					Two Hundred Year Flood" in
					rivers where no annual flow data was available, but some characteristics of
					the watershed were
					known. This was a statistically challenging problem as it
					required not just a
					prediction of an expected value, as in a typical ML problem, but the
					prediction of the highest
					quantiles of an unknown distribution, using sometimes very limited data from
					'similar'
					distributions. </p>
				<p> Building
					upon existing approaches and under guidance from both MDS Mentors and
					BGC's experts, my team made improvements to both the machine learning and
					statistical components of
					the prediction process, ultimately creating a system that reduced prediction
					error by 84% at the key
					0.995 quantile. Our pipeline script is currently in use by BGC Engineering
					in the backend of their
					proprietary
					software 'Cambio' to guide engineering decisions and keep Canadian
					communities safe.</p>
				<p> Our project and final presentation was selected as a "Top 3 Best Project" by
					UBC MDS peers and
					staff, and was recieved extremely well by BGC's community of Engineers and
					Hydrologists following
					our company wide presentation.</p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/mds.png" alt="" /></span>
				<h2> Master of Data Science</h2>

					Data Analysis and Applied
					Statistics, NLP, Data Visualization, Time/ Spatial Modelling, Databases and
					Data Retrieval,
					Algorithms and Data Structures, Cloud Computing</p>
				<p> I completed my Master of Data Science degree in July 2023. The UBC MDS was
					an invaluable experience
					for me, as it is designed to take passionate students with strong STEM
					backgrounds and train them
					into
					industry ready Data Scientists. The
					program covered the full spectrum of data science skills, from basic data
					wrangling to advanced
					machine learning, and everything in between. I fully immersed myself into
					the work, driven to make
					the most of the learning opportunity and finding immense joy and fascination
					with the subject
					matter.

				<p>I was outspoken and passionate about my learning and experience in the
					program, and was recognized as
					a leader both academically and socially, being elected for multiple terms as
					student-faculty
					representative. I also tremendously value the interpersonal connections and
					friendships I forged in

				<span class="image main"><img src="images/vsb.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<h2> Secondary Science Teacher</h2>
				<h4> Vancouver School Board | June 2020 - Aug 2022</h4>
				<p> After finishing my Bachelor of Education at UBC, I began teaching with the
					VSB. I taught Science 9
					and AP Chem 12 at Eric Hamber
					Secondary in 2020
					and Science 10 and Chemistry 12 at John Oliver Secondary in 2021/22, as well
					as being a
					Teacher-on-Call. </p>
				<p> My time as a teacher allowed me to develop exceptional public speaking and
					presentation skills,
					which has ultimately become one of my greatest strengths as a Data
					Scientist. I began to understand
					the different ways that people learn, and how to present complex new
					information in a way it could
					be understood and utilized by listeners. </p>
				<p> Teaching also taught me excellent leadership, planning and multi-tasking
					skills. As a teacher, you
					are solely responsible for your students’ learning and the smooth operation
					of your classes. This
					required meticulous planning of materials as much as months in advance, but
					enough flexibility to be
					able to modify these plans on the fly as issues arose. I also learned to
					manage the activities of
					dozens of students, often engaged in different activities, especially during
					potentially hazardous
					chemistry labs. My experience has a teacher has made me much more
					comfortable acting as a team
					leader and manager in professional situations, as well as imbuing me with
					personal organization and
					time management skills that I have carried forward to every aspect of my
					life. </p>
				<p> During my time as a TOC, my duties centered around continuity, ensuring
					classes proceeded as
					normal
					for students even with their main teachers away. This required me to learn
					to improvise in
					unexpected situations and be extremely adaptable to daily changes in work
					environment, tasks, and
					curriculum. My diligence and effectiveness were frequently recognized by
					host teachers, who returned
					pleasantly surprised that they were able to continue their lesson plans with
					no disruption upon
					their return. I was frequently personally requested as a substitute,
					particularly by those
					teaching senior STEM courses where class time is precious and more subject
					matter knowledge is
					required. </p>
				<p> While I enjoyed my time as a teacher, I realized I needed a more
					intellectually challenging career
					path. I learned about data science from a friend and alumnus of the UBC MDS
					program, and realized
					data science was a way for my love for math and statistics, which I had
					previously thought were
					limited to academia, to be utilized to solve real world problems. I
					immediately began my pivot into
					data science, beginning with applying to the UBC MDS program.</p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/bed.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

					This foundational
					education equipped me with invaluable analytical, mathematical, and
					problem-solving skills, which I
					have carried forward into my career as a Data Scientist. </p>

				<p> During my senior year of study, I undertook several substantial projects,
					ranging from wet-lab
					investigations to large-scale process design endeavors. These projects
					included creating biodiesel
					from waste oil from a local cafeteria, optimizing reactor performance using
					statistical analysis,
					and designing a chemical plant for a novel production process. These
					experiences exposed me to the
					intricacies of industry-scale collaborative problem-solving, the design of
					complex, multi-step
					experiments, and the analysis of technical processes. </p>

				<p> My background in chemical engineering has been instrumental in my data
					science career, enabling me
					to approach challenges with a structured and methodical mindset. I have
					developed strong
					organizational and leadership skills, which have proven extremely valuable
					when working with Data
					Science teams and tackling complex, ambiguous investigations. My engineering

					at UBC Geering UP. In
					this role, I designed and led week-long Environmental Engineering camps for
					groups of over 20
					students, fostering an environment of critical thinking, collaboration, and
					inquiry. </p>

				<p> This position instilled me with a passion for education and mentorship,
					which was the original
					inspiration behind my pursuit of teaching. It was in this position that I
					first became comfortable
					with presentations, public speaking, and breaking down complex concepts for
					learners, which are
					skills I
					carry forward as a Data Scientist to share knowledge and insights derived
					from my work to empower
					my teams and foster innovation. </p>

				<span class="image main"><img src="images/Krav.png" alt="" /></span>
				<h2> Self Defense Instructor </h2>
				<h4> Krav Maga BC | Feb 2015 - April 2019 </h4>
				<p> At 19, I began teaching as a Self Defense Instructor at Krav Maga BC, having
					been nominated by the
					gym owner and lead
					instructors for the instructor apprenticeship program based on my leadership
					in classes and passion
					for the
					system as an athlete. </p>

				<p> I took on a mentorship role in the community, empowering individuals with
					valuable self-defence
					skills. With over
					500 hours of teaching experience, I designed and led training programs for
					Krav Maga classes and
					seminars, catering to groups ranging from 5 to 25 students. </p>

				<p> My responsibilities extended beyond instruction as I actively contributed to
					the growth and
					development of our community. I played a pivotal role in grading and
					evaluating students during
					level testing, ensuring they achieved proficiency in self-defence
					techniques. I also had the
					privilege of mentoring and training new junior instructors, fostering a
					culture of continuous
					improvement and expertise within the organization. </p>

				<p> Hello, I'm Samson, a Data Scientist based in Vancouver, B.C. My journey into the world of data
					science has been shaped by a diverse background that includes an academic foundation in chemical
					engineering and a career as a high school science teacher, before my pivot into tech and data with
					my Master of Data Science degree from UBC. </p>

				<p> As a former science teacher, I discovered my passion for simplifying complex ideas and fostering
					learning. Today, I apply those skills in the data science realm, where I uncover insights hidden
					within data and communicate them effectively to drive meaningful decisions. The most sophisticated
					technical solutions never get off the ground if their stakeholders don’t understand them, and my
					time
					as a teacher has helped me to develop masterful communication and presentation skills. </p>

				<span class="image main"><img src="images/hike.jpg" alt="" /></span>

				<p> Beyond the world of data, I'm an advocate for an active and healthy lifestyle. I've embraced the
					beauty of Vancouver by exploring its trails, hiking in its mountains, and walking the local seawall.
					I am also a former competitive bodybuilder, and while I no longer compete, I continue to train and
					maintain a strong connection to the world of fitness and health. Through bodybuilding, I have
